**MyMonero:** due to a very broad DDoS attack at the data center in which MyMonero is hosted (not targeted at MyMonero) the service was offline on Sunday for a 12 hour stretch. We are putting some effort in place to ensure this does not happen again in future. New features added this past week: a "copy to clipboard" helper is now available on the right of your Monero address on your dashboard, as well as on the login key review screen and account details screen. In addition, clicking on a transaction in the dashboard or your transaction history screens will show additional details, such as the payment ID used.

**ForkGuard:** added MyMonero.com and MoneroClub.com

**I2PD:** massive progress was made this week adding support for the su3 router update format (the previous .sud / .su2 format being deprecated), which is used to deliver updates to all routers on the i2p network, including: router update alerts, plugin update alerts, reseed data, and news feed items. Details on the su3 format can be found here: https://geti2p.net/en/docs/spec/updates
