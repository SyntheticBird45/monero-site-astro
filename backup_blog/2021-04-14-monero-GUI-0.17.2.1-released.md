A GPG-signed list of the hashes is at [https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/hashes.txt]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/downloads/hashes.txt) and should be treated as canonical, with the signature checked against the appropriate GPG key in the source code (in /utils/gpg_keys). To ensure that the files you download are those originally posted by the maintainers, you should both check that the hashes of your files match those on the signed list, and that the signature on the list is valid.

Two guides are available to guide you through the verification process: [Verify binaries on Windows (beginner)]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html) and [Verify binaries on Linux, Mac, or Windows command line (advanced)]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html).
