### Overview

This is the v0.14.0.2 minor point release of the Monero software, and it is part of the v0.14 network update. That major release was due to the March 9th network update, which in turn added a new PoW based on Cryptonight-R, added a new block weight algorithm, and introduced a slightly more efficient RingCT format. This is a intermediary, stable release specifically for the network update, and does not represent the bulk of the effort on Monero over the past 6 months. That effort will be in the 0.14.1 release, which will follow in March after the network update.

Some highlights of this minor point release are:

- Added fix from Ledger for change bug with subaddresses
- Fix crafted coinbase tx mishandling in wallet
- Fix JIT build on mac
- Make slow hash request a restricted RPC request
- Fix off by one in block weight in regtest mode
- Fix fork rules determination for old daemons
- Fix estimated block height for GUI/API
- Fix sync wedge when an incoming tx is already in the pool
